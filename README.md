*Real-Time Resource Allocation Simulation*
This project demonstrates a basic resource-sharing problem in real-time systems. It's designed to give a simple, clear understanding of how processes interact when accessing limited resources.

*How It Works:*
Simulated Processes:
Multiple processes try to access a shared resource with a limited capacity.

*Resource Management:*
The program ensures:

No more than the allowed number of processes use the resource simultaneously.
Processes wait if the resource is fully occupied.
Randomized Delays:
Random timing introduces variability, simulating real-world scenarios.
*Purpose:*
Introduces synchronization concepts like mutual exclusion and fairness.
Helps build foundational knowledge of real-time systems.
*Acknowledgments:*
This project is a learning step in understanding system-level programming and resource management in engineering studies.
